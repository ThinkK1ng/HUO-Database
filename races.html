      Races of Neova
    </h1>
    <p class="text-4xl text-center text-white">
      The races of Neova are varied and strong, each of them offering unique
      benefits. Though there are some places where coexistance thrives,
      <br />Not all interactions are clean and just. War is not unheard of, and,
      unfortunately it does them no favors against the greater Gogmagog threat.

          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            Alone, humans are not as threatening as some of the other races, but
            they are the most abundant. Built in the image of the goddess, they
            are the closest to her realm.<br /><br />Racial Trait - Arianrhod's
            Guidance: +20% exp gain and 30% increased faith skill damage. 10%
            increased damage taken from magic skills.

          <h3 class="text-3xl">Elf</h3>
          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            Though elves have the second smallest population amongst all the
            races, numbering only in the thousands, they make up for this with
            their immense magical knowledge and longevity. The races with the
            longest lifespan, some elves have been known to live well past two
            thousand years, marking them as the wisest of all races and scholars
            like no other.<br /><br />
            Racial Trait - Forest's Blessing: +100 MP and 30% increased magic
            skill damage. 10% increased damage taken from shadow skills.

          <h3 class="text-3xl">Dragonkin</h3>
          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            Prideful and mighty, the Dragonkin are a curious race. Once Human,
            they made pacts with the ancient dragons and were bestowed with
            their might. Their population grew from there, and though they are
            only 7 thousand strong to this day (the smallest population of
            Neova, in fact), they live nearly as long as the elves. They are
            almost indistiguishable from humans, if not for their slited golden
            eyes.<br /><br />Racial Trait - Dragon Force: 10% increased faith
            skill damage, 15% increased elemental skill damage, 15% increased
            physical skill damage and acess to a Dragon Form. Dragon form has a
            duration of 100 seconds (10 replies) in which all stats are
            increased by 100% and has a cooldown of 600 seconds (60 replies). 20%
            increased damage taken from all sources.

          <h3 class="text-3xl">Orc</h3>
          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            Once a bitter enemy to the human race, while not overly friendly,
            Orcs are now considered allies thanks to the peaceweaving of their
            greatest past leader Sorg. Taller and more muscled than any other
            race, the only ones that come close to them in physiacl ability are
            the Dragonkin. Their thick skin makes them the most durable of the
            races, making Orcs hard to bring down.<br /><br />Racial Trait -
            Sorg's Might: 30% increased defense and physical skill damage.

          <h3 class="text-3xl">Vampire</h3>
          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            Humans who were tainted by the evils of the Gogmagog, they are a
            race divided. Some wish for Neova to fall, others hate what has been
            done to them and wish the Gogmagog to die. Fully capable of sucking
            the life from all those around them, Vampire's are a frightening foe
            to have.<br /><br />Racial Trait - Voracity: 10% increased shadow
            skill damage and 60% increased self healing. +10 points of
            additional damage added to skills for every stack of Ravenous. 1
            ravenous stack gained per enemy killed, 15 stacks max. 20% increased
            damage taken from faith skills.

          <h3 class="text-3xl">Beastman</h3>
          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            The Beastmen are the scond most prominent race on Neova, numbering
            nearly as many oas the humans they govern themselves in their own
            kingdoms. Tensions between them and the humans tend to be
            non-existent and they enjoy the peace and trade with them. Their
            relations with the Orcs, however, are even better.<br /><br />Racial
            Trait - Instinct: 30% increased agilty, 15% increased recon skill
            range and duration, and night vision.

          <h3 class="text-3xl">Dwarf</h3>
          <p class="text-2xl mt-10">
            Short in stature but brawny and smart, the dwarves are the greatest
            engineers of Neova. They are third largest race in the land and have
            been responsible for the vast majority of Neova's technological
            advances alongside the elves. They have a healthy rivalry there.
            Almost polar opposites of the elves, the Dwarves prefer to live in
            hot mountains so they have plenty of raw material available to them
            for their forges.<br /><br />Racial Trait - Magni's Hammer: 30%
            increased fire skill damage and 10% increased physical skill damage.
            10% increased damage taken from water skills.
